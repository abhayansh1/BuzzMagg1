Participants solve a problem from scratch and develop a working prototype in a short span of time. The fourth edition of HackRush was held over a period of one week due to the pandemic. This year, several problem statements focused on long-term development and short-term competitions from different domains, including web development, app development, machine learning, and cybersecurity. With over 130 participants, several projects were successfully completed and are on their way to deployment!<br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29H.png">Course and Graduation Plan Tracker<br><br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29I.png">Event Management System<br><br><strong>Tinkerers Lab</strong><br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29J.png"><br><br>In the past year, the Tinkerers Lab has undergone a lot of changes! Apart from moving to a new space in AB 4/111 due to the upcoming supercomputing facility, the lab has gained a fresh look with a design based on merging ergonomics with aesthetics. The lab has acquired several new machines, including 3D printers, PCB millers, and Vinyl Cutters. An updated booking facility and the new website has made the lab more accessible. Expect changes to keep coming as the Tinkerers Lab continues to grow into a Tinkerer\'s dream! Apart from the various logistical changes, the TL team has also held several workshops throughout the year, such as the Virtual Build-a-thon, A hands-on introduction to IoT, Augmented Reality, ROS, and Matlab.<br><br><strong>InsIIT</strong><br><br>InsIIT is the next chapter in making the IITGN campus more accessible and technology-driven. Kicked off via HackRush 2019, this project was brought to life with a vision to create a one-stop-serves-all platform for all community members. The project incorporates several aspects of the campus and deeply integrates into services that students use on a daily basis. With over 15 features in active development, the team is on its toes to substantially change the way students and faculty go about their daily lives in the institute. The project is available under the Open Source - IIT Gandhinagar umbrella organization on GitHub and is looking for active contributors who can learn mobile development while contributing to the student life at the institute!<br><br>Here is a quick sneak peek at what&rsquo;s going to come next ;)<br><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"> <img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29K.png"></div> <div class="col-md-6"> <img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29L.png"></div></div><br><br><strong>Stumble</strong><br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29M.png" style="margin-left:35% !important; margin-right:35% !important; width: 30% !important;"><br><br>Stumble emerged out of an SSOP project in 2020 when a group of creators came together to learn how to build mobile apps. Seeing their batchmates have difficulty contacting seniors for advice, they created an application that connects like-minded people within a community.<br>The app allows users to:<br>* Exchange ideas, photos and connect with people through messaging them directly.<br>* Showcase skills and interests<br>* Search for relevant and interesting people based on their achievements and skills.<br><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"> <img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29N.png"></div> <div class="col-md-4"> <img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29O.png"></div><div class="col-md-4"> <img class="para-img" src="../Assets/29P.png"></div></div><br>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0028.html', 'articleNo': '0029', 'nextArticle': '0030.html'};
