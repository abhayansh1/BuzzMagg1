Are they related or completely different and how?</strong><br><br>My major in college was Electrical Engineering. I also did a Minor in CSE along with that. Currently I am working as a software engineer at Enphase Energy which is not related to my major but related to my CSE Minor as I learnt different computer science subjects and technologies that I use on a daily basis.<br><br><strong>How did the college prepare you for the real world?</strong> <br><br>&quot;College provided me with lots of opportunities which helped me to explore my passion, learn the value of teamwork, develop leadership skills, and apply classroom learning to real-life problems. It helped me develop my lateral and analytical thinking which have helped me in approaching situations with new insights and awareness, and also a strong network of friends and teachers that has made me more open minded.&quot;<br><br><strong>Top 5 things you learnt at college and never forgot? How did those learnings help in your future career?</strong><br><br>&quot;The 5 important things I learnt at college are: <br>1) Working in Team Environment and its importance<br>2) Time Management<br>3) Learning from mistakes<br>4) Good Communication Skills<br>5) Problem Solving<br>I think all of them play a significant role in my daily life and help me to communicate better with my teammates, manage my time efficiently and to be productive and achieve great results.&quot;<br><br><strong>What importance does IIT Gandhinagar hold in your life?</strong><br><br>IIT Gandhinagar holds a great importance in my life. I have learnt a lot during my 4 years of college life which has helped become a better person and I feel that the college phase was one of the amazing phases of my life.<br><br><strong>How would you describe your personality before coming to college and how it changed during 4 years of B.Tech?</strong><br><br>&quot;Some of the changes that happened in my personality are:<br>1.) Meeting different types of people and listening to their experiences broadened my horizons and made me more open minded. <br>2.) Leading different teams helped me to improve my communication skills and to develop leadership skills.<br>3.) Working together in teams for different projects helped me learn to deal with different situations and various other social skills.&quot;<br><br><strong>What advice would you give to a first-year B.Tech student?</strong><br><br>I would say to explore as many things as you can during these four years which will help you find where your true passion lies and what you want to do in life.<br><br><strong>What was your most favourite and least favourite thing in the college?</strong><br><br>&quot;My most favorite thing was late night hanging out with friends.<br>I did not enjoy the morning 8:00 AM compulsory attendance classes much.&quot;<br><br><strong>If you would have the opportunity to do it all over again, what would you do differently?</strong><br><br>I used to miss a lot of my classes in the first 3 semesters. However, later I realized that attending classes regularly makes it much easier to understand the subject and prepare for exams rather than reading notes or books on the last day or some days before the exam. So probably if given a chance, I will try not to miss many classes.<br><br><strong>How did you come out of the challenges imposed due to the pandemic on you?</strong><br><br>Fortunately I didn't lose my job during this pandemic situation. Additionally I developed some new habits to overcome the boredom of staying locked in the house which include book reading and listening to podcasts.<br><br><strong>Advice to our students, especially the graduating batch amidst the pandemic.</strong><br><br>&quot;Take care of yourself and your family during this pandemic. Connect with different people and grow your network as it would help you in finding various opportunities for you as well as your friends. Utilize the extra time in learning some new skill that you feel will be required for you to pursue your goal.&quot;<br><br>", 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0030.html', 'articleNo': '0031', 'nextArticle': '0032.html'};
