He has been involved in various initiatives of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India, to promote techno- entrepreneurship and innovation clusters.<br><br>This interview was moderated by Nimit Agarwal, a sophomore in Electrical Engineering.<br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - Good afternoon sir, greetings from Torque magazine. In this edition, we have decided to have a special mention in which we highlight IIEC, the Innovation and Incubation Centre of IITGN, so we would like to get some insight into it.<br><br>To start, Can you give us a brief about IIEC, its mission, and its undertakings.<br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - Thanks, Nimit. This is an excellent initiative by TORQUE magazine highlighting IIEC. We've seen a growing interest in entrepreneurship among students in the last couple of months, and this interview will help propagate the idea of IIEC to many more students interested in entrepreneurship. <br><br>IIEC is the arm of IITGN to promote entrepreneurship among the students, alumni, faculty, and anybody from outside. So anyone who has a good idea can approach IIEC for support. We are an incubation centre supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India; Department of Industries, Government of Gujarat; and various other ecosystem players. <br><br>The objective is to support and nurture entrepreneurship among the students and identify promising entrepreneurs. We help the entrepreneurs identify the real business challenges and work on them to take their product to the market, impact society, and for the various stakeholders, be it investors, mentors with the start-ups, and employees of that start-up. <br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - How many start-ups are currently incubated under IIEC? How many of them have been successfully established? <br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - Currently, we have more than 15 start-ups at the Incubation Centre in different stages and levels. Some of them are at the ideation stage. Some have developed their products and are validating them - taking market and customer feedback. Some are actually in the commercial ideation phase, selling their products to the customers and scaling up! <br><br>Over the past four years, we have supported more than 25 start-up companies. Many of them have graduated, raised funds and are into the revenue stage doing quite well! So the overall success matrix is quite diverse.<br><br>We see the current requirement of the start-up and provide the necessary support at the initiation stage to reach the next logical level. We make sure to stress test your idea - validating it whether it is worth pursuing or not.<br><br>Once you have identified an idea worth pursuing, the next step is to go through the proof of concept. We provide the necessary support regarding mentorship and network and anything else required - access to a lab or some initial capital to validate your idea. <br><br>Once the idea is validated, we support taking that idea for commercialization - identifying the customers, doing market research, creating a business plan etc. We will help you get funding for your idea, early customers, networking with investors etc. Then you proceed to the next stage. <br><br>For us, it is the success. We have helped several start-ups over the past four and a half years now who have pursued and reached the next level, where they have raised external funding from the venture capital firms. Or, even if they have not raised funding, they are successfully running their businesses. <br><br>To give some statistics, we have helped at least seven start-ups raise around 1.5 crores. And when I say funding, it is not just from venture capital firms or external financing; it's funding from various government sources as well! By utilizing this 1.5 crores, these start-ups have generated revenue of more than 7.5 crores creating employment opportunities for more than 100 people! Mind you, these are just seven start-ups that are at the revenue stage. I am not counting the start-ups at the early stage of product development or proof of concept!<br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - That's great, Sir!? Were there any challenges faced by IIEC and the start-ups incubated there during the lockdown period due to Covid-19? How did everyone manage to overcome those challenges?<br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - Of course, we were not ready for many challenges at the beginning of the lockdown. But as time progressed, we created sustainable systems to overcome the difficulties.<br><br>For example, in the beginning, several start-up founders were staying on the campus, and the biggest challenge then was to go out of the campus to meet their customers! So most start-ups did several other things to utilize their time well and make the most of the situation by ideating and doing things that could be done in-house.<br><br>That was also a time calling for innovations to help the fight again Covid-19. Some of these start-ups tried developing ventilators. One of them collaborated with a company to develop a ventilator prototype. Another team created an autonomous UV based disinfectant system. Another group created a smartwatch that triggered an alarm when somebody touched his/her face multiple times. This way, the start-ups tried to utilize maximum time reading things and doing research which may help the society at large, and as some degree of normalcy returned, they again started working on their products.<br><br>This was an opportunity for many of them to just give in. For instance, we have a start-up that works to create content for a lot of industries. And thanks to the lockdown, there was a paradigm shift focusing on making everything digital and online, be it a marketing campaign or reaching out to the customers etc. Thus they got a huge opportunity to create a lot of content for many large, midsize and even smaller companies, and they grabbed it well!<br><br>There were challenges for start-ups working in the infrastructure and real-estate domain as the activities suddenly went down to nil. So it was difficult for them to work, but they continued, and now after almost a year, they are working well, learned a lot of things while they were in lockdown. <br><br>Overall most of the start-ups incubated at IIEC continued to work during the lockdown period, focusing more on their product and its validation. They now have a better and more precise articulation of what they are proposing or trying to do and how to do it.<br><br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - Sir, what support did IIEC provide to the start-ups to help the start-ups combat Covid-19?<br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - I would say human support - which is exceptionally pivotal! We interacted with our students when the lockdown started. We initiated an Entrepreneurial Mindset 101 program for our students and invited most of our start-ups as guest speakers or included their experiences and journey as case studies for the program.<br><br>Whenever there was a need for financing or accessing some lab, we made sure to address those. For instance, one of our teams was working on developing a ventilator prototype and had to meet doctors, medical practitioners and industry experts - this was when everything was locked down!. We did our best to connect them to doctors ad practitioners and provide the necessary support.<br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - What are your views on the start-ups currently working in the Incubation Centre regarding the quality of products and services they offer. Are there any of them you think have a high chance of making it big soon?<br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - Big is a contextual comparative. Just to give an example, I am sure that you are aware of Micob, our start-up that has developed a concrete 3D printer. This lockdown period so gave them a lot of opportunities to validate their products. They created the 3D printer on campus and made a lot of furniture currently being used in many places on the campus and other areas as well!. They also worked on creating prototypes for army bunkers. They made a design habitat for workers. They used this time to test their products for different places. They are taking some 40,000 square feet of area outside the campus to start their manufacturing facility. I am sure that in the next couple of years they will be doing a lot of business! They are also in touch with the investors for raising funds. <br><br>At the start of the pandemic, we started this program, &quot;Nidhi Prayas&quot;. In the first cohort, we selected nine start-ups, comprising of our alumni, current students and even people outside IITGN. They are working on their ideas, and I'm optimistic that by the next one- one and a half year, we will be able to file at least one patent for all these nine ideas. All of them are product based ideas identifying very specific problems in the healthcare, smart manufacturing, IoT and energy sector and look very promising. I'm sure they will be successful in the market. <br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - Sir, do you think that the current Covid situation came as a blessing in disguise for the entrepreneurs?<br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - I indeed believe so! As I mentioned in the example of the content writing marketplace start-up, covid gave them the time to think deeper into the problem they are trying to solve, iterate on their solutions and proposed business models and connect with many people!<br><br>One blessing in disguise happened with networking. Earlier, we used to invite mentors from different parts of the country or the world. Scheduling was a challenge, as sometimes they may not be available on the proposed dates and so on. Now with covid, everyone is available online, and we could leverage our mentor pool very well for our incubated start-ups!<br><br>Other than this, we also leveraged our labs' utilization, especially Tinkerers' Lab, during this phase. The start-ups working on web-based products were also able to utilize their time well. We also organized several workshops and programs for our students. One of them was called High Growth Venture Program, wherein some of our start-ups and start-ups from different parts of the country participated. It was a three-month program and was quite intensive. Some of the very successful entrepreneur business leaders were made mentors for the team, and they get a chance to interact with them one-on-one. Many mentoring sessions like these followed up! Because of the online availability of the mentors, we leveraged this blessing in disguise to our best!<br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - What advice will you like to give to the budding entrepreneurs - how to get started, how to find their niche, and how to prepare for their hustle of starting their own venture?<br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - <br>If you are interested in entrepreneurship, start and try to fail and learn early and move on without losing enthusiasm. <br><br>Your first idea may not work, or your first proposed solution may not be feasible. Entrepreneurial mindset and attitude is that of iteration and learning from each iteration and being better in the next one. Failure is a stepping stone and is very important to experience it in entrepreneurship.<br><br>If you want to be an entrepreneur, being at college is the best time to experiment. This is the time when you learn and try and fail. Once you are in professional life, people may or may not encourage you to fail, so here's an opportunity for you to try - give it your best shot and learn!<br><br>If you see, 7-8 per cent of our alumni have started their own companies. Multiple alumni started a company when they were a student or had just graduated. They failed, then went to corporate, got some experience, learned, and started a company. You need to have that instinct. Whenever you find a problem worthy of solving, find a problem wherein you feel there is a potential for commercialization, and you will do it. But the learning which you had when you were a student, while you tried your first start-up and failed, will aid you immensely when you are working on your idea.<br><br>Therefore I would say try and think of ideas, identify problems ad we're happy to help you! The IIEC team will provide the necessary know-how, the necessary support in terms of mentoring infrastructure required for you to pursue your idea more systematically. <br><br><br><strong>Nimit</strong> - Sir, it was indeed great talking to you! Thank you so much for taking out time today for this interview.<br><br><strong>Mr Anand Pandey</strong> - Thank you. I hope, and I am expecting you to start and keep working on your ideas for a start-up and then encourage others to start!<br>", 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0025.html', 'articleNo': '0026', 'nextArticle': '0027.html'};
