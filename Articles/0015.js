This very word has engulfed the entire human race. Yet, we don\'t know what the future has in store for us as we currently fight our present. It was all normal for everyone. People were busy with their usual daily routines and hustle-bustle of their lives. Then suddenly, one day, people around the world heard the term - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) aka Coronavirus. From this very day in 2020, the conditions began to worsen. More and more countries reported covid cases. These cases kept on increasing. The medical sector was not acquainted with treating such a disease before. Several governments imposed a lockdown to curb the spread of the virus and give some time for doctors and scientists to figure out solutions.<br><br>Normal life was brought to a standstill. Everyone was confined inside their homes, much like the animals in the zoo. It marked the beginning of a new normal. Masks and sanitisers became typical household stuff. With no human insight on the road, the animals must have wondered if the entire human race has been wiped off the earth. Several employees lost their jobs or had to face pay cuts. The GDPs plundered worldwide.<br><br>However, like the dual-faced coin, the dark side also had a ray of hope complementing it. Humanity stepped up. Coming to the Indian context, several organisations and individuals came to the forefront to support the daily wagers and underprivileged by providing them with food every day. The government and the industrialists ramped up the production of medical equipment. Several retired officers and doctors joined hands to wage war against the pandemic&mdash;the doctors, police officers, railways, etc. (the list is endless) became our frontline warriors, the real heroes of our lives. <br><br>In record time, scientists worldwide built up an antidote against the disease - the vaccine. As a result, several countries have started vaccinating their population with the hope of becoming maskless one day. However, what lies ahead for us in the future? <strong>One of the prime observations from the current pandemic is that even the developed nations failed to keep themselves alienated and safe from the disaster. </strong>Of course, one of the reasons could be recklessness and neglect of the national governments. But that is part and parcel of the response of the nation. If developed countries like the US and the UK struggled, one can wonder what the condition would be in the underdeveloped nations and the developing nations. Unfortunately, several underdeveloped nations are yet to receive vaccines. They lack medical resources. The virus mutates every few days. When we are able to cope up with one wave of the pandemic, the probability of another wave looms large. We have not been able to find a solution to this problem. <br><br><strong>Are we ready to face such pandemics in the future? </strong>This question needs critical thinking and analysis by scientists and governments. If such pandemics keep on coming at frequent intervals, then we would always remain engaged in fighting with them. Even Bill Gates mentioned that the next pandemic could be ten times worse, and we are unprepared for it [1]. The affluent nations would quickly gain access to better resources and leave the underprivileged ones to look after themselves (or be at the mercy of their wealthy counterparts). The current pandemic has even opened up a new arena for ill-minded temperaments. Till now, we have only heard of a biological war in books or movies. But after seeing the devastating impact of the current pandemic, terrorists and several evil frames can use biological viruses capable of consuming masses in a blink of time to meet their wrong goals and wipe off a significant chunk of the population. <br><br>On an ending note, the covid pandemic has several lessons incorporated into it. <strong>It is our responsibility to learn from it, protect humanity in the future, or be ready to face doom.</strong><br><br><br>Reference:<br>[1] <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/364371">https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/364371</a><br>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0014.html', 'articleNo': '0015', 'nextArticle': '0016.html'};
