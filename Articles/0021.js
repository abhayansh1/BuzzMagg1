Tech '18, IIT Gandhinagar", 'authorImg': '../Assets/avatar.svg', 'articleContent': "The United Nations&rsquo; Universal Declaration of Human Rights classifies access to healthcare as a human right. Seems like a straight answer to the topic of the essay right? Actually, the problem does not lie in the definition of human rights, rather it lies in the interpretation of its meaning by various economies. <br><br>An efficient healthcare system can play a significant role in shaping a country&rsquo;s economy, development and industrialisation. Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general, physical, mental health and well-being of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease to be completely eradicated by deliberate human interventions. This just goes on to prove how much the healthcare industry can influence the welfare of mankind. A well-functioning health-care sector is therefore a prerequisite for a well-functioning economy. <br><br>Globalisation and Industrialisation has led to privatisation of many sectors of an economy. The healthcare industry is not an alien to this invasion of corporate force. A repeated notion strongly (though with subtlety), put forward by the leaders of the private healthcare sector is that healthcare, just like other consequences of privatization, is a &lsquo;commodity&rsquo;. <br><br>The very first problem encountered in the distribution of good healthcare services is that there isa problem of supply. The level of sophistication needed to provide healthcare services is toohigh for it to be abundantly available that too at an affordable cost. Doctors go through rigoroustraining for years before treating a patient. It takes a huge amount of investment on their parttoo, for being able to equip the right skill set for treating patients. Hence, due to market supplyand demand forces keep the prices for healthcare at a higher end. From a moral perspectivewhen we say that we must ensure that there is affordability for each and every individual to getaccess to healthcare services, we must also ensure that people providing these services areadequately compensated.<br><br>Compensating providers is just a part of the net price; there are many other administrative costs as well. However the caveat should be the word basic necessities and defining what classifies as basic healthcare. Just like subsidized food wouldn&rsquo;t entitle receivers to world-class biryani and caviar, subsidized healthcare wouldn&rsquo;t mean world-class healthcare and free cure of cancer. <br><br>In principle, the idea of a particular service or product being treated as a commodity is not bad at all. However, free access to good healthcare services should be considered as a fundamental human right. When I say that it is a fundamental right, I do not just mean that everyone should be allowed to have access to healthcare services as long as they pay for it. However as a morally responsible society, we should decide to provide basic minimum services to everyone who needs them, so that they don&rsquo;t struggle to merely survive. <br><br>One other perspective which criminalises the idea of commodification of healthcare is that certain types of services are connected to the integrity of a person. Buying and selling such services is an attack to the dignity of humankind itself. Furthermore, creation of markets for purchase of such services promotes perverse incentives in the minds of people providing these services. Allowing establishment of such markets is an act meant to violate the integrity of a human being. It is due to this reason that buying or selling of human organs is considered as a criminal offense all around the globe. <br><br>Seemingly obvious, to some people, privatisation of the healthcare sector may not easily fit into the perspective mentioned above. The usual argument given against commodification of healthcare services is that &#8203;medical care should be distributed according to need and not on the basis of someone's ability to pay. <br><br>Now there is an incendiary idea that lies in the statement above. The notion of need for healthcare and someone&rsquo;s ability to pay should not be considered as two separate entities. One can be in need for medical care and at the same time be self-sufficient to pay for it. Now the natural question to arise is &lsquo;What about the people who are in need of healthcare but are in no condition to afford it?&rsquo; The existence of poverty cannot be considered as an argument for socialised medicines just like it cannot be considered as an argument for socialised food. It is an argument for income support and poverty alleviation policies. The poverty argument fails to capture an important aspect of healthcare which is different from other poverty issues. <br><br>The important difference between food &amp; clothing versus healthcare in case of poverty ridden families is that it is extremely easy for a person to judge when his stock of food will run out. On the other hand, the need for healthcare can arise suddenly. Say, a poor family staying near to the coastal region is struck by a sudden need of food. There is no surprise element to the need for food in this case. But what happens when the same family is struck by a tsunami and people get injured. A disaster can strike any time. A pandemic disease can strike any time. Nobody can predict when they would be in need of medical care. Even the most prudent person in the world may not be able to set aside an appropriate amount of money to pay for his or her medical care when such a situation presents itself. <br><br>This is why unlike food and clothing, there is a need for insurance agencies for healthcare. It is this uncertainty in the need for medical services that drives the market for insurance policies. In the USA, healthcare is almost exclusively paid through insurance services provided by highly diversified health organisations. The total expenditure statistics of national healthcare of the United States suggests that 68% of healthcare expenses are on professional services, hospital care and prescription drugs. While government public health activities and medical equipment expenditures only amount to 6%. <br><br>Hence markets for health insurance evidently are a subject to a variety of problems. <br><br>Like every other product, insurance claims have an expiry date. Quite often it's seen that the insurance agencies pose questions in order to stall your claim and push it past the expiry date. Sometimes, there is unclear documentation which hazes out what kind of problems the insurance covers. Focusing on the role of insurance also shows how misleading it is to put emphasis on the principle of distribution according to need rather than ability to pay. All insurance systems, whether public or private, distribute resources according to need. Car insurance provides new cars to people who &lsquo;need&rsquo; them, i.e., those who just totalled their old ones. Fire insurance provides new houses to people whose old ones burned down. But in neither case is state intervention necessary. <br><br>Thus it does not help the case of public provision of healthcare services to appeal to the principle of distributive justice. I believe that if we speak as though health care were a pure public good in our society it will make it all but impossible to distinguish between objectionable and unobjectionable forms of privatisation.", 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0020.html', 'articleNo': '0021', 'nextArticle': '0022.html'};
