True, but I believe that there is always a silver lining. It just presents itself in ways that are not so obvious. In the past 1.5 years, many things have been thrown in the bin, but several others pushed on and made a lot of things possible.<br><br><strong>Innovation in Education</strong><br><br>Online learning is inherently stressful. There is no peer-to-peer interaction, and let&rsquo;s face it, many of us were sleeping behind that camera. However, behind those muted mics was a lot of constructive talk on how to deliver the best education possible during these trying times.<br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/16B.png"><br>Apart from just shifting to the online mode, several institutes around the globe (including our own) made a concerted effort to not sacrifice on hands-on-learning, which forms a big part of several curricula. Packaging and sending learning kits with electronics and other items helped several students get a natural feel of the subject, even if they were not in the institute.<br><br>In rural areas, where modern technology is often hard to come by, an NPO came up with the idea to teach in extensive open grounds while providing instructions via a speaker&mdash;truly making lemonade from lemons!<br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/16C.png"><br>Coincidentally, a much-needed change in the Indian Education system also came during the lockdown in the form of the NEP &lsquo;20, which revamps an old curriculum with required skills in the 21st century.<br><br><strong>Tech</strong><br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/16D.png"><br>Work from home will probably not die soon, but poor internet and intermittent cuts are not helping either. Enter NVIDIA -> They have developed Maxine, a deep learning framework that offers high-quality video reconstruction while using a bandwidth requirement that is 10x lesser than what is needed now! <br><br>Have a weak device and not able to play games? Remote gaming has also become increasingly popular, with The Gaming Project being the first Indian company to offer cloud gaming to the likes of Geforce now or Google Stadia for free! <br><br><strong>Medicine</strong><br><br>Doctors have been our saviours, and to their aid come engineers and academics, who have developed tools that vastly improve patient outcomes. Virti is an augmented reality-based coaching tool adapted to train frontline workers with essential skills regarding safety and patient protocols. Studies around the product have shown that the technology boosted knowledge retention by up to 280% compared to traditional training! <br><br><strong>Space</strong><br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/16E.png"><br>Some may say that we have just entered a new space race (one that India has a place in). The pandemic year saw a considerable number of innovations in the space industry. For the first time in human history, NASA has successfully flown a rotor powered craft on another planet (Ingenuity).<br><br><strong>Lemon = Air pollution, Lemonade = Tiles?</strong><br><br>It is no secret that our environment saw some recovery when everything was forced to shut down. Accelerating this process is an Indian start-up called Carbon Craft Design which developed a unique method through which polluted air emitted by industries is converted into designer tiles. They use carbon capture technology to convert more than 30,000 litres of contaminated air into a single great looking usable tile!<br>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0015.html', 'articleNo': '0016', 'nextArticle': '0017.html'};
