The nature treats &#8222;sun&#8223; as the greatest medicine. Now have you thought how long this medicine is going to last? Most probably, not for many days since we humans have imbalanced the ecological system and playing with nature without sensing that we are inching slowly towards death. The cause would be sun and effect will result in disease , destroying our immune system , temperature hike etc. Imagining this situation will certainly shiver one&#8223;s body .It is the result of mankind deeds who has forgotten everything in his pride. We are a small creativity of the nature but we are challenging the creator through our development. The mankind has broken the agreement between us and the creator. This has led to a global threat of &ldquo;Climate Change&rdquo;. <br><br>Climate change is a indicator of change in Earth&#8223;s atmosphere and its components. It has become a worldwide problem today. Climate change is actually variations in many aspects like sudden season change, failing of crop cycle, extinction of plans &amp; wildlife, famines , droughts, storms , spike in temperature, increase in sea level, frequent floods etc. The economy of a country suffers depression which hurdles the development factor of the country. <br><br>Melting of glaciers are a very sensitive indicator of the climate change. They are melting slowly resulting in increasing sea-level and decreasing glaciers. Some countries are making walls but don&#8223;t think that the walls would prove dwarf if melting continues. There will be no islands left also. <br><br>Radioactivity decay has resulted in water pollution by developed countries. The problem of armament has increased use of tanks and atomic weapons. It has lead to dumps of garbage causing soil pollution. <br><br>Greenhouse gases play a crucial role in climate change .Greenhouse gases such as CH4, CO2 etc. absorb the infrared solar radiation and help in maintaining the Earth&#8223;s temperature. Increased greenhouse gases beyond the limit especially after Industrial Revolution resulted in global warming. Recent trends of burning &#8222;Parali&#8223; in western parts of the country has contributed a lot . CFCs from refrigerators, air conditioners and perfumes deplete the thickness of ozone layer the ozone layer. It causes skin diseases and sunburns of UV rays. It has happened due to increasing complexity in lifestyle. <br><br>Rapid industrialisation has increased the Air Quality Index (AQI) to a threatening level. The air has become toxic leading to acid rain .To meet the population demands , green fields are set onto fire and are being turned into concrete buildings for a better lifestyle. Abrupt and reckless use of natural resources has increased the pollution beyond the control extent. It has become carriers of many diseases such as heart attack, asthama ,bronchitis, headache etc. <br><br>The world&#8223;s largest greenbelt &ldquo;Amazon rainforest&rdquo; is destroying at a rapid speed which account for house of 70% biotic species. Himalayan vegetations are also facing such danger. These vegetations are home of plants of medicinal values like &#8222;Sanjeevan Booti&#8223; . The trees help in maintaining the bank of the river . Trees are said to be &ldquo;Green Gold&rdquo;. 33% forest cover is needed for a balanced environment. A UN report says that in tropical climates , forthcoming years will see extinction of about 700 plants. Some species are counting their last days. Plants and wildlife are interdependent on each other . Destroying any one will lead to natural disturbance in food web. Deserts are expanding resulting in frequent famines. <br><br>Consequences of the climate change and global warming in 20th century brought United Nations and the other world organisations to focus on the safety of environment . Vienna conference (1987) focused on depletion of ozone layer . Some policies were discussed which were introduced globally. A pact was signed in Montreal Summit (1987) took place. Many countries emphasised to take up immediate steps on the climate change globally . World Meteorological organisation (W.M.O.) and United Nations Environment Programme &ndash; Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (UNEP-IPCC) . This organisation plays a key role in handling the policies of Climate Change globally. Almost, about 200 countries are the <br>members of IPCC. The main objective of IPCC is to observe and specify the dangerous consequences effects and address the ways to tackle climate change. It creates a report on the findings and publishes scientific report. IPCC was awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for it&#8223;s contribution . <br><br>A conference on climate change in Japan (1997) came out with Kyoto Protocol which ensured each participant countries to decrease the temperature by 1.5 degree Celsius. The Rio De Zenerio , Brazil Framework Convention on climate change passed a proposal for each country to cut greenhouse gases product by 5%. The developed countries need to extend some support to developing nations. They should act as a role model. They should take the first step to leap forward and create awareness. <br><br>To encounter this problem a clean development system needs to be developed and for this, the theory of Carbon Credit was introduced in November 2007. Over the years, the climate change issue is being focused in many conferences. In 13th ASEAN Summit, the topic included &#8222;Energy and climate change for sustainable development&#8223;. The &#8222;Paris Climate Pact&#8223; was signed by about 190 nations in 2016 to reduce carbon percentage and global temperature . However, no significant changes in this direction has taken place .<br><br>Undoubtedly, climate change has become a global issue today. It seems extremely difficult . But if we have consistent devotion and willpower, then our continued efforts will certainly give fruitful outcomes. Efforts needs to be done on a global basis but the first effort needs to be done at personal and community level . <br><br><strong><em>&ldquo;Arise, Awake &amp; Don&rsquo;t stop until the goal is reached &ndash; Swami Vivekananda&rdquo;</em></strong> <br><br>Development and environment are not opposite of each other ,in fact they are complementary of each other . The quality of life is dependent on healthy environment development is dependent on natural resources. Development is necessary but natural resources should be used in a sustainable and balanced way. We should use them judiciously. It is also necessary to use natural resources without destroying the nature cycle in an eco friendly manner. Population control also needs proper attention and awareness to meet increasing demands . <br><br>To maintain the beauty of our earth, it is the need of the hour to come out of our selfishness and save the environment. Earth is the only planet which supports life. It is a matter of happiness that many countries and NGOs have come forward to take initiatives make the blue planet a better place to live in and decorate the nature with it&#8223;s charm once again. Particularly, the developed countries should make a fund to help the developing countries to tackle this global cause. <br><br>Using energy saving devices, renewable energy resources, plantation drives, stopping poaching , treating industrial effluents before running them in the mainstream . These would certainly help our forthcoming generations to gift them a healthy environment . <br><br>Climate change should not be an issue of debate. We should learn from our culture. Movements like &#8222;CHIPKO ANDOLAN&#8223; needs to be initiated again. Certain strict policies regarding the environment should be framed by the government . The main aim is to provide safety or bring up new forests and increase the vegetation cover . Governments programmes like &#8222;Krishi Vaaniki&#8223; are useful in shaping the greenery of nature. These initiatives would help us in a longer run for better future. Awareness needs to be created . <br><br>The main cause of imbalancement is our view point towards nature and the viewpoint of government towards development . We have so deeply engraved ourselves in Western culture that we are forgetting our own culture and our values with environment . We should develop ,but not by competing with nature and resources . This does not mean that we should not progress with science and technology . We should progress but by using the natural resources judiciously for a sustainable environment . <br><br>Our dreams and visions would only be explored if we have a healthy environment to live in . We will have to return to our culture to save the environment for sake of the mankind . <br><br><strong><em>GO GREEN ! <br><br>&ldquo;REDUCE , REUSE , RECYCLE&rdquo;</em></strong>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0022.html', 'articleNo': '0023', 'nextArticle': '0024.html'};
