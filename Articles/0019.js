He has been involved in some interesting and groundbreaking research activities related to the outbreak of the SARS COV-2 pandemic and the presence of the virus in wastewater. His research work attracted major traction and has been much recognized in academia. In this interview, Prof Manish Kumar throws light on his work and also tells us what his daily routine looks like beyond the classroom hours!<br><br><strong>&lsquo;People count their money, I count my papers!&rsquo; <br><br>&lsquo;I vividly remember, on May 8th 2020, I went out in full lockdown just to bring samples from wastewater. It was the first time when my family members asked me not to go to work (as if I am going to the border!)&rsquo;<br><br>&lsquo;This was not planned by me, but it happened because they denied me for the first time. From this we could also prove that the samples can be stored at room temperature where previously people thought storing at 4 &deg;C was mandatory.&rsquo; <br><br>&lsquo;I am a typical Cancerian - I do not like to go out but once I am out, I start enjoying myself!&rsquo;<br></strong><br><strong>Can you briefly explain what you work with and how it is related to our theme, &lsquo; Beating The Blues&rsquo;?</strong><br>My research was based on the detection of SARS COV-2 in wastewater. When the whole world was suddenly spread with the virus, none of us knew what to do except locking us down. Understanding the spread of the virus was a challenge both technically and scientifically. Many countries around the world have done testing. But for a country like India, where the population is huge, we had challenges related to the number of testings and the locations of testing required. This was the time when we came up with Wastewater Surveillance. But there was no proof as to whether this would work or not. It was also the time when the supply of commodities was low and we had to adjust and work with whatever we had in the lab. I vividly remember, on May 8th 2020, I went out in full lockdown just to bring samples from wastewater. It was the first time when my family members asked me not to go to work (as if I am going to the border! Their fear was true because I was going out to take the samples from hospitals where the Covid patients were treated. Even then, we collected samples from different places and tried to prove the concept and work upon it. It was then that IIT Gandhinagar became the first institute to prove this theory of presence of SARS COV-2 in wastewater. As it is not possible with the claim of just one institution amongst the several virology institutes present out there, we collaborated with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board for the sampling, and with the Gujarat Biotechnological Research Centre for expanding our reach. Our work in the month of May proved the theory and I am proud to say that we earned a COVID-19 research award from KCPC(Kiran C Patel Centre).<br>The passion we had behind all this was the constantly bothering question in our mind, &lsquo;How can we contribute to this situation?&rsquo; <br><br><br><strong>Can you tell us more about your team? Did your team have any students?</strong><br>Yes, Kaling Taki, a PhD student from the Civil Engineering department was working closely with me! This is very unique and perhaps this can happen only in IIT Gandhinagar,where I&rsquo;m the main supervisor of a student from a different department! Luckily for us, he was already trained for two years with NGS [Next Generation Sequence, genome testing]. M.tech and PhD students of IIT Gandhinagar have to take up independent Seminar and Projects which have to be different from their main research field. As a part of these projects, Kaling Taki has already done a lot of work with NGS. He also worked on a project at the Newcastle University UK, involving scanning water samples for different pathogens. So even though his core domain was geotechnology, Kaling had a fair bit of experience for our research work. I can now call him a scientist - he has been awarded his PhD!<br><br>Both of us started together and published one of the earliest reviews on the Science of Proto-Environment in the world which is now reaching around more than 30 citations! This review ignited a lot of interest and traction from the academia and my peers started believing in me. Then, Arvind Patel who did his PhD with me and has been with me for 10 years agreed to go with me for sampling and we promised to be a part of every step we walked together - from sampling, analysis, treatment, processing and working on the extracted data. Now today he shares this award with me!<br><br>At the end of the day, all this sounds like a fairy tale with a happy ending, but those were the times of great difficulties. We had pressures from our families requesting us to stop doing all this, but somebody has to stand up in these times. We believed in each other in every step we took trying to decode this dangerous virus and its anomalous behaviour and properties. There were many other M.Tech, PhD students who came to write on several aspects of the virus after us.<br><br>Even today, the SARS-COV2 is a giant elephant and every blind person describes it in their own way. <br><br><strong>At the start of your research, people were a lot afraid and confused about what was going on. In such difficult times how did you keep your team and yourself motivated and what made you work even though the risk of infection was high?</strong><br>Since the time I joined IIT Gandhinagar, I had a very deep urge to make Prof.Sudhir Jain [Director, IITGN] proud of me. I did my PhD from Tokyo University and later I spent one year in the US , but, when IIT Gandhinagar gave me a position, I thought that I have a chance to give myself the best possible label as a faculty in the country. <br><br>As a child and a young student, I always wanted to make my father proud, but after coming here, I always wanted to make Prof. Jain proud of me. This has worked in some way to keep me motivated towards my research work.<br><br>The second thing that helped me immensely was my international network. Sometimes things fall aligned with destiny. A global collaboration of scientists was made by the University of Notre Dame to fight this [pandemic] together. They also wanted a representative from India. At that time, only I had a paper published on this virus. So they contacted me and I accepted it as it was a work for a noble cause. Then we were given a lot of attention from the media, perhaps because of the research being spearheaded by an IIT Professor and they started covering our work. IITGN was featured as one of the contributors to this global collaboration of the scientific community. After a few weeks, I started getting calls from the media personnel about the result and progress. At that time I thought that if I do not come up with a result it would be very embarrassing (said laughingly). Yeah, so maybe all this motivated me to continue my research on the SARS-COV2 virus, even in difficult times. <br><br><strong>How did you come up with this research idea and how sure were you about the process?</strong><br>Sometimes, not knowing is a bliss. When we started, we did not know many things about the enrichment method and the processes involved in testing. As we went on, further challenges came up.<br><br>I believe in jumping into the water to know if we will swim or sink rather than making a list of challenges about to come up and thinking about the solutions. The latter seems a waste of time to me.<br><br>When I took the sample bottles to the Gujarat Biotechnological Research Centre (GBRC) for the first time, they denied analysing it even though they had promised earlier. At that time, they had a lot of samples to be tested and could not test my sample on priority. I could not do anything but asked them to keep the sample with them because I could not take it with me to the campus. Two weeks later, I received a call from them saying that they are ready to analyse, but I knew that we needed a fresh sample. We went back and brought a new sample, after analyzing this, I also analysed the sample which was two weeks old kept at room temperature. Now my paper contains a comparison of two samples. This was not planned by me, but it happened because they denied me for the first time. From this we could also prove that the samples can be stored at room temperature where previously people thought storing at 4 &deg;C was mandatory. <br><br><strong>Can we know what your typical day looks like when you are not in your research lab?</strong><br>My typical day starts at 4:30 AM or 5 :00 AM because from childhood, I never could sleep for more than 5 hours. My father lied to me that a person needs just 5 hours of sound sleep. And from almost my 7th grade, I slept only for 5 hours! Now my system has been set and I wake up in the fifth hour no matter what time it is. If I sleep at 11 pm, I leave the bed at 4 or 4:30 in the morning.<br><br>From 5:00 to 7:30 AM, I generally do my editorial responsibilities because I am a guest editor or a part of the editorial board for many academic journals. I also write some emails and make social media posts at this time, because these tasks need good concentration levels as they will be read by many people. <br><br>I am a typical Cancerian - I do not like to go out but once I am out, I start enjoying myself! I like arranging my bookshelves and my surroundings. Sometimes I cook for my children for breakfast. As far as my hobbies are concerned, I have my list on Netflix. I do a lot of research to put things on my watchlist! Whenever I watch a movie, I tell myself &lsquo; hey look I am giving you movie time so don&rsquo;t complain while I work&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s my own way of training myself to give my best while working. <br><br>I also like to program and tune myself and so I write a diary. I also love to write about my papers, how many are under review or revision or preparation or even about the next idea. I do this on my weekends or any other free time. People count their money, I count my papers! I already have planned 30 papers for this year and last year we could cross over 50 papers in the Covid times!<br><br><strong>Your study is the first in India. It is the first proof of the capability of wastewater surveillance of the novel coronavirus disease in the country. How do you feel about it?</strong><br>It has brought me onto the National scene. Recently I was invited to give an interview to a panel on Rajya Sabha TV. I could see my family and my parents were very much elated. Though nothing much has changed in my living style or my day to day activities, I get a lot of attention if I tweet something or if I write something. It seems as if more responsibilities are attached to me. My papers are read and looked at with much more seriousness so I check thrice before writing something (said laughingly) So, to be honest, it seems like a lot of burden, but I feel very responsible to lead the group at the same time as I was the first to set the proof for my theory. So all this feels good, getting the award and using the money to buy a new iMac (said laughingly). But I would say that if I had not been at IITGN, I would not have enjoyed all this. Today I feel happy and proud as my work is now recognised on my campus. As I give this interview, I feel the worth of taking that risk that day!<br>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0018.html', 'articleNo': '0019', 'nextArticle': '0020.html'};
