Tech '17, IIT Gandhinagar", 'authorImg': '../Assets/avatar.svg', 'articleContent': "Public Healthcare is an important feature of all countries&rsquo; infrastructure today. Healthcare facilities and services help the citizens in battling and fending off deadly infections, accidental and deliberate injuries and non-communicable disorders to expand the average lifespan and improve upon the quality of life people are leading. Events that cause significant harm to the body, that could not be treated by the application of domestic remedies alone, and therefore, it <br>becomes inevitable that everyone at some point of their lives desires a solid medical infrastructure to deal with their problems. There has been a considerable amount of debate regarding the status of healthcare and the services medical professionals provide amounts to a publicly guaranteed right or a commodity that its customers need to purchase. A major example of this would be the establishment of the National Health Service(NHS) in the UK. <br><br>Every debate has a context, in this particular case, we need to look at the American case. In almost all other nations, free or cheap public healthcare is provided to the citizens, albeit through a very broken system in countries like India. Therefore, the case primarily addresses issues of public policy rather than ethical issues. Summarizing the commodity argument, there are two main points that are raised: <br><br><strong>&ldquo;Medical professionals are relatively highly paid, and medical education and research is extremely expensive. Therefore, there would be a massive burden on the public exchequer. Therefore, we must charge the citizens for their use.&rdquo; </strong><br><br><strong>&ldquo;Free healthcare will incentivize citizens to neglect their own health. Rise of non-communicable diseases is due to poor diet and lifestyle among people and is a major cause of death nowadays.&rdquo; </strong><br><br>Let's examine each of these points. In this essay, I will try to argue that these concerns are the byproducts of implementation, rather than public health itself. After that, I will put forward ethical reasons for the welfare of citizens through cheap and universally accessible public healthcare. <br><br><strong>&ldquo;Free healthcare will incentivize citizens to neglect their own health. Rise of non-communicable diseases is due to poor diet and lifestyle among people and is a major cause of death nowadays.&rdquo; </strong><br><br>It&rsquo;s entirely true that poor lifestyle choices like fast food, intoxicants, lack of exercise, adherence to safety norms and hygiene promote health risks. Take the example of the USA. Over 31 percent of the population is obese, another 39 percent is overweight. Fentanyl and Opioid addiction runs high and wide. That means over 70 percent of people carry several complications like high bad cholesterol, diabetes, overexertion of body frame, hypertension, mental health <br>issues, too high/too low blood pressure, poor joints, weak lungs, hypernatremia, body image issues etc. Thus, they would be a burden to the healthcare system. However, these problems, like malnutrition in India, occur disproportionately among the poorer sections of the society. Contrary to the point, these issues actually highlight how for-profit healthcare could potentially destroy societies. From fast food and cola companies funding medical research to essentially bribe experts into telling the populace that their products are safe, to strategic consulting firms promoting therapy as a marketing strategy so that more and more people buy antidepressants and their clients, the pharma companies make profit, essentially leading to the current drug addiction situation in the US, to extremely overpriced drugs which are essentially rebranded, reflavoured and repackaged version of old drugs, produced after years of bureaucratic paperwork encouraged by established companies to subdue new competitors(contrast this with India&rsquo;s experience with generic drugs and its status as a biotechnology powerhouse and a mass producer of affordable drugs). <br><br>Public sector intervention would have avoided those problems. Stern regulations don&rsquo;t work, because they benefit the Big Pharma who can afford the paperwork. All while legit inventions like GM crops are caught in a political mess. <br><br><strong>&ldquo;Medical professionals are relatively highly paid, and medical education and research is extremely expensive. Therefore, there would be a massive burden on the public exchequer. Therefore, we must charge the citizens for their use.&rdquo; </strong><br><br>Life saving treatment for particularly severe conditions, as proved by the current coronavirus pandemic, can be expensive enough for most of the bearers. While the taxes are mostly borne by those who could afford the treatment. Detractors often point to insurance as a solution, but insurance is often restrictive and doesn&rsquo;t cover enough costs when chronic treatment is required(after all, they also have to remain profitable). People on the lowest rung of the society <br>often have insecure sources of income, therefore are often not qualified to be availed insurance services. Therefore, health services are a requisite part of their welfare. <br><br>Private medical education is atrociously expensive everywhere in the world. To counter that, Indian government has expanded the number of available seats for public medical colleges. Several means-cum-merit based scholarships also exist, however, ultimately, the government needs to deal with this monopolizing cabal with an iron fist if it really wants the costs to go down. Considering healthcare as a right and the domino effect expensive education has on the morale of doctors would provide an actual ethical reason and justification for the government to decide the profit margins in this industry, and make them more humane. <br><br>Several private medical institutions, drug manufacturers and hospitals already exist in the country, and provide excellent service to their customers. Private players act as disruptors, and bring forward new innovations that can change the prevalent medical procedures drastically. Indeed, they deserve excellent benefits. However, if a public-private partnership model that could bring down the charges faced by the consumer through subsidies, donations, grants, <br>nonprofits and endowments, it greatly helps both parties. Most importantly, it creates an atmosphere of trust for the patient. In a private setting, many-a-times the patients cast doubt at their doctors or pharmacists, suspecting them of prescribing unnecessary tests and medication in order to earn more both from fees and commissions. On a considerable number of occasions, this turns out to be true. In a public service model, this doubt is eliminated and the quality is judged totally on the outcome and the facilities provided by the third party. <br><br>We need to understand the ethical grounds for the implementation of universal healthcare. On several occasions, the patient has no control over his/her circumstances that lead to him/her needing healthcare beyond what (s)he could afford. A major accident, birth defect, genetic abnormalities etc are essentially out of control at this point of time. The treatments for such are above what most people could afford. In this scenario, denial of treatment for monetary reasons becomes a contravention of the person&rsquo;s right to life, and reflects poorly on the society as a whole. In absence of the belief that healthcare is a right and not a commodity, the medical service providers can&rsquo;t also be blamed for this situation arising. Keeping all this in mind, it won&rsquo;t be foolish to state that treating healthcare as a right rather than a commodity or service to be bought and sold can elevate the overall security and standard of living in the country. <br><br>In conclusion, I will put my argument to rest with this essay that Healthcare is indeed a right, and should be provided to all citizens for the development of the country. That being said, there is no essential need to prohibit private players at any level within the system, and they would foster life-changing and groundbreaking innovations. Overall, a societal outlook mandating healthcare as a right would greatly advance the cause of human progress. <br>", 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0021.html', 'articleNo': '0022', 'nextArticle': '0023.html'};
