This chaos playing with the mindset of MBA aspirants is one-of-its-kind, very different from that observed in crowded markets or metros. The chapters inside explain what it is very lucidly, but to highlight the crux, it has completely moulded our perception of this educational program. And its consequence is such that many young MBA holders, whether employed or unemployed, adversely suffer because they consciously choose to fall prey to it.<br>\n<br>\nThe fat pay-cheques one gets, the work-life balance one has, the quality of education it offers, its ability to create outstanding entrepreneurs, and many alike are the kind of responses heard when we ask someone: &rdquo;Why MBA?&rdquo;. But are all these beliefs actually true? Or are they gimmicks to lure the laymen? Ranging from professional, to educational, and even entrepreneurial misconceptions related to MBA, this book clarifies them all.<br>\n<br>\nSpoiler Alert!<br>\n<br>\n(Contrary to what the title of this book might sound like, you might still decide to go for an MBA after reading it. But this time, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same &lsquo;you&rsquo; who decided to choose that route just because many others were doing so. Be it any career choice you make, once you are done with the read, you will be much clearer about your thoughts than you might have ever been. So clear that you will hold ZERO regrets for them, and that too, forever.<br>\n<br>\nSounds like a surreal commitment? Fortunately, it&rsquo;s been proven to work for many, and should do the same for you too if you are ready to hold your breath until the end of the book.)<br>\n', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0029.html', 'articleNo': '0030', 'nextArticle': '0031.html'};
