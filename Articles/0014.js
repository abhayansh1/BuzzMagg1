And although the modern educated human defines illiteracy as being unable to read and write, the room for the usage of this word has only grown in the past one year. Almost like the not so friendly virus that has me confined in my room currently along with a handful of other countries.<br><br>So, let&rsquo;s cut to the chase. Somebody most probably ate something they shouldn&rsquo;t have or came too close to one, which is why we are all here now. The scale and magnitude of the pandemic is something that modern day population and health care systems were just not prepared for. However, we humans are also a resilient bunch and the entire world was up in arms to do whatever was necessary to fight this virus. At least initially, because somewhere down the line things got slightly blurry.<strong> Soon enough we had not one but two enemies - the virus and ourselves.</strong> <br><br>I remember distinctly when the virus outbreak began, people started to hoard items of daily use such as soap, sanitizers and toilet paper. This led to an increased shortage of several items of daily use and resulted in a subsequent inflation spike. The brunt of which had to be faced by individuals belonging to the lower rungs of our social and financial hierarchy. This in my opinion made the infamous &lsquo;capitalist pig&rsquo; in all of us very apparent. <strong>The capitalist pig waits for the world to burn only to pick up what didn&rsquo;t catch fire and sells it at the price of gold.</strong> However in my opinion, had the masses made better decisions and not got crazed so easily, we might have had a relatively much better situation at hand.<br><br>To top this already unfolding madness was the absurd conspiracy theory that China had engineered the virus in a lab and this was it&rsquo;s way of getting back at the americans. I am sure the chinese are smart enough to understand that we live in a global village and that what happens to the west would surely and definitely affect the east. And there is nothing better than money that brings us closer. Even the chinese I&rsquo;m sure would agree to that. In fact, even after repeated studies and experts commenting time and again on the nature of the virus, people continued believing what they wanted to believe. Even my father wasn&rsquo;t spared and to this very day, he refers to the CoVID-19 virus as the &ldquo;Chinese Virus&rdquo;. I finally decided to talk to him about it. Upon countering him, he would very conveniently point towards the &lsquo;Spanish&rsquo; Flu. Least knowing that the Spanish flu was called so because spanish media was the first to cover it while the rest of the world was busy fighting the first world war. Spain had other things to worry about as they were not part of the war at that point. The spanish flu had indeed wreaked havoc in other countries but some of us were too busy fighting wars to even think about it at that point of time. This just comes to show that we humans always need a scapegoat onto which we can all pile our hatred and frustration. In this case, it was the chinese who had to take the fall. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong though. I still expect the chinese to own up to what they did and issue a statement. However, I don&rsquo;t expect an apology for &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; a virus. They never did that. Nobody did.<br><br>I am angered by the fact that uncontrolled bushmeat consumption is what resulted in this virus. If stricter rules and regulations regarding bush meat were enforced by the chinese government, this pandemic could have definitely been avoided. And I say this with extreme caution because this isn&rsquo;t the first time that a zoonotic event like this has occurred. A virus jumping from an animal to humans has happened before. Ebola, Swine Flu, AIDS are also examples of viruses that found their way into humans from animals through various zoonotic events. <br><br>However, this is where the infamous coronavirus gets tricky, as this one has learnt from it&rsquo;s cousins. It has realized that killing its host too quickly, although might sound tempting but it actually brings its own spread to an almost stand still. Thus, this time the virus decided to become less lethal in order to become highly communicable. As a result, it spreads like wildfire. But - Enter Anti-maskers. (and other such people who think that the coronavirus is a hoax.) Such groups with their tall claims that they shall never die, and that the virus has a very minimal death rate fail to realize one thing, i.e., the collapse of the entire health care system. With all beds taken up by CoVID patients, we are denying patients with highly lethal conditions of a bed. Unfortunately, this ultimately results in deaths that go unreported under the heading of CoVID-19. The post mortem report will now definitely not show CoVID as the cause of death. Rather, it will show some other cause which might&rsquo;ve been avoidable had the patient received timely medical care.<br><br>Fortunately, some of us are still resilient and some of us put in the extra time and effort to come up with vaccines. But yet again, vaccines too are met with loads of scientific illiteracy and malice from the masses. From absurd arguments such as pregnant vaccinated females having kids born with deformities, to people just bluntly believing that the vaccine would kill them, the list of myths and lies that surround vaccines sees no end in sight. <strong>Some are questioning the vaccine because it came out too early. </strong>But what people fail to realize is that unlike previous vaccines which took a much longer time to test and manufacture, recent vaccines take much less time because our technical and scientific wealth and prowess has also increased exponentially. And become cheaper too. Thereby resulting in the number of vaccine manufacturers meeting all necessary quality requirements to the tee.<br><br>Thus, it is of utmost importance that we understand that our blatant ignorance and self serving narratives are only causing us to suffer more. And for much longer. We must have faith in the health and pharmaceutical system that has served us time and again and co-operate with them in every way possible. We must do our bit as responsible citizens and not pass off CoVID as something for the weak. It&rsquo;s a full blown pandemic. The entire world is talking about it. When was the last time everyone talked about something so extensively? Hence, as an earnest request to all - Please shed your veil of ignorance and don&rsquo;t be an educated fool. Don&rsquo;t be illiterate. Don&rsquo;t be an <em>Abhana.</em><br>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0013.html', 'articleNo': '0014', 'nextArticle': '0015.html'};
