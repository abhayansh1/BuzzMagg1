It has indeed taken a profound psychological and emotional toll on all of us. Except the pandemic did not start on a blank page - before the pandemic, many of us would have already faced some hardships related to jobs, relationships, health etc. Throughout the world, psychologists and mental health experts have been calling out this &lsquo;hidden pandemic&rsquo; being prevalent yet going unnoticed for quite some time now - perhaps years!<br><br><strong>The world we live in is a VUCA world - it is Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous.</strong> The pandemic has added a whole new dimension to this - destabilization of our support systems. We saw health systems collapse even in the most advanced countries. We saw frontline workers working unusually overtime to take care of the patients. We saw ourselves being asked to stay in isolation, social distancing was imposed, and we saw our loved ones succumb to the virus. Humans are social animals, and we draw a lot of strength and resilience from our environment. Thus, when the environment itself undergoes dramatic changes, it spills grief and trauma. Mental health is an intrinsic value as it relates to us as humans. Anything that threatens mental health, especially in large numbers, threatens the very core fabric of our society.<br><br>I&rsquo;m sure reading all this now, you must be feeling anxious and maybe even depressed. You are probably wishing for a way out. You would want things to get back to normal. You may want to delete the year 2020 from history and somehow want a magical &lsquo;refresh/restart&rsquo; button to make a fresh start - just as you WANT it to be - all normal. Now here&rsquo;s a little problem.<br><br><strong>We humans have a penchant for homeostasis. We want to go back to normal, not to a &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo;</strong> Ask the average person what it means to be &ldquo;resilient&rdquo;, and they&rsquo;ll say some version of &ldquo;bouncing back&rdquo; from adversity. We want our economy to bounce back, and we want to get back to our jobs, schools and routines. Except that&rsquo;s not actually resilience.<br><br><strong>Resilience doesn&rsquo;t mean bouncing back to normal. It means being transformed towards a new normal.</strong> Resilience is not a state of being but a set of skills honed through adversity. To be resilient isn&rsquo;t to go back to being the way one was before. It is to allow oneself to be changed, see the cracks in the self or the system, let the light shine through, and become stronger at the broken places.<br><br>Let&rsquo;s talk about why developing resilience may be the most important thing you can do for your well-being right now. But, before diving further, take a test to get your resilience. <br><br><a href="https://bit.ly/3gr71qZ">Resilience Test Link.</a> <br><br><em>About the Resilience Test: The assessment is based on 15 years of scientific research from one of the USA&rsquo;s top resilience experts, Everyday Health Wellness Advisory Board Member Amit Sood, MD. Dr Sood is the executive director of the Global Center for Resiliency and Well-Being, creator of the Resilient Option Program, and former professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</em><br><br>A study by Ohio State University was conducted to understand resilience and its connection to our physical and emotional health. In the study, the researchers interacted with people living - and thriving- with incredible challenges, including mental illness, physical disabilities, stage 4 cancer, trauma, death of a family member, and loss of a loved one by suicide. And they found out that resilience was at the core of their ability to cope and thrive! The biggest &lsquo;aha&rsquo; insight revealed from their study was that higher levels of resilience are directly related to better outcomes when living through a crisis, managing chronic disease and chronic pain, and improving emotional and physical health.<br><br>Resilience is the process of adapting in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, or other significant sources of stress. Becoming resilient helps you work through difficult events, but it also helps you grow and improve your life, even in the absence of adversity. Some people refer to resilience as &ldquo;bouncing back,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s more than that. Being resilient includes learning from past experiences and developing new coping strategies moving forward.<br><br><strong>How to build resilience? </strong><br><br>1. <u>Observe yourself and your surroundings</u> <br>Are you experiencing stress symptoms? Are you facing anxiety? Feeling tired? Sleeplessness? Irritability?Headaches? Shortness of breath?Agitation?Rapid Heartbeat? Difficulty relaxing?<br>Acknowledge and observe what you are experiencing, and write it down. Name it. <br><br>2. <u>Practice Acceptance</u><br>People misunderstand acceptance. Acceptance doesn&rsquo;t mean being okay with what isn&rsquo;t okay or acting as though hard things are easy. It means acknowledging that things are not as we want them to be and then finding ways to live and even thrive despite that, changing what needs to be changed even when it&rsquo;s tough. Acceptance often means forging a new path. Accept what you are going through and let it flow through you. <br><br>3. <u>Work on your thought Process</u><br>Like building muscle, increasing your resilience requires time and dedication. If you don&rsquo;t put in the work, it might atrophy. People are conditioned to think of resilience as a personality trait (either you have it, or you don&rsquo;t), but this isn&rsquo;t the case. With intention and practice, you can become more resilient, no matter your age.<br><br>It&rsquo;s challenging to maintain an optimistic outlook when the future feels so uncertain, but positive thinking will help you focus on hope and visualize better times ahead. When you feel flooded with negative thoughts, own them. When you say your thoughts out loud and talk through them, they lose their power.<br><br>Practice gratitude. You may not realize how lucky and privileged you are in these tough times, having a roof over your head, food on the table, and healthwise good. Imagine someone who faces difficulty with each breath he/she takes. Count your blessings and keep a positive attitude. Your subconscious mind plays a huge role in shaping your thoughts and your actions!<br><br>4. <u>Build your social connections</u><br>Building a support network of empathetic and compassionate people helps you feel less alone in times of need. We&rsquo;re physically distanced but can still connect and check up on each other through text messages and video calls. Social distancing doesn&rsquo;t have to mean anything more than physical distancing. We can stay socially close and reach out to each other in different ways!<br><br>We often underestimate what huge influence our social circle has on us, emotionally. It plays a subtle yet crucial part in our emotional, physical and social well being! So keep your friends tight!<br><br>5. <u>Be mindful of your activities.</u><br>Practice Deep Breathing, Meditation, engage in some physical activity, focus on eating healthy and ample hydration, prioritize sleep, minimize social media consumption and be mindful of your media consumption. Take small steps each day to build your resilience muscles, which will help you through this crisis and any future adversity. Remember, small steps create magic!<br><br><br>They say opportunities emerge from the greatest adversities. We will come out of this pandemic better than we went into it. We have to! <strong>We could be better, stronger, but most importantly, <em>different</em> than before. </strong>When we realize we can&rsquo;t hit rewind, we can&rsquo;t undo what&rsquo;s been done or what&rsquo;s happened; we often have to stop and re-evaluate where we are headed. This too shall pass, and we&rsquo;re going to get through this pandemic in a way that will change us. We have to change by becoming more robust and resilient, having learned some lessons about us, our thought processes and each other. We cannot simply hide our heads under our pillows and wait for this to pass. When you wake up in the morning, say to yourself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just a passive victim of this terrible pandemic. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to work toward getting us through.&rsquo;<br><br>It would be a shame to go all through this and then say to ourselves, &ldquo;We missed a great opportunity there to learn more.&rdquo; <strong>So instead, build your resilience, a small step a day, every day!</strong><br>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0012.html', 'articleNo': '0013', 'nextArticle': '0014.html'};
